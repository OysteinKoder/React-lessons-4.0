Task: Publish your portfolio on github pages

- install the gh pages package
    yarn add gh-pages --save-dev

-In the package.json file add these lines before "build": "vite build"
    "predeploy": "npm run build",
    "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist",

-In the vite.config.js file add this line before plugins: [react()],
    base: "/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME/",

- Commit and push your changes to the repository

- In terminal type
    yarn deploy


    Gotcha: 
    if you get this error message: Failed to get remote.origin.url (task must either be run in a git repository with a configured origin remote or must be configured with the "repo" option)
    - copy the url for your repository
    - write this command in the terminal
        git remote add origin <paste the url here>
